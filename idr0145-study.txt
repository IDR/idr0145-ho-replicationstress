Study Title	Mec1-Independent Activation of the Rad53 Checkpoint Kinase Revealed by Quantitative Analysis of Protein Localization Dynamics				
Study Type	high content screen				
Study Type Term Source REF	EFO				
Study Type Term Accession	EFO_0007550				
Study Description	The replication checkpoint is essential for accurate DNA replication and repair, and maintenance of genomic integrity when a cell is challenged with genotoxic stress. Several studies have defined the complement of proteins that change subcellular location in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae following chemically-induced DNA replication stress using methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) or hydroxyurea (HU). How these protein movements are regulated remains largely unexplored. We find that the essential checkpoint kinases Mec1 and Rad53 are responsible for regulating the subcellular localization of 159 proteins during MMS-induced replication stress. Unexpectedly, Rad53 regulation of the localization of 52 proteins is independent of its known kinase activators, Mec1, and in some scenarios independent of Tel1, or mediator components, Rad9 and Mrc1. We demonstrate that Rad53 is phosphorylated and active following MMS exposure in cells lacking Mec1 and Tel1. This non-canonical mode of Rad53 activation depends partly on the retrograde signaling transcription factor Rtg3, which also facilitates proper DNA replication dynamics. We conclude that there are biologically important modes of Rad53 protein kinase activation that respond to replication stress and operate in parallel to Mec1 and Tel1.

Protocol Description	The 322 GFP-tagged strains were grown to mid- logarithmic phase in liquid Synthetic Defined (SD) media and imaged on a 384-well imaging plate (PerkinElmer 384 Cell Carrier Ultra, 6057300) in a high-throughput confocal microscope (PerkinElmer Opera High-Content Screening System) as previously described. Briefly, cells were treated with MMS and imaged at 7 timepoints over 4 hours (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 minutes). The addition of drug to each column of the plate was staggered by 1 minute to compensate for the imaging time of the Opera microscope. For each time point, 4 different regions of the well were imaged. Both GFP and RFP was imaged on the microscope with 800 ms exposure. Cells expressed a constitutively cytoplasmic tdTomato fluorophore, and whole cell image segmentation was conducted using CellProfiler based on tdTomato signal. Dead cells displaying high GFP fluorescence were removed from the analysis. An automated quantification scheme was developed using custom written Python scripts to acquire measurements of GFP pixel intensities for each individual cell from all obtained images.				
					
# Phenotypes					
Phenotype Name	change in protein localization				
Phenotype Description	Single cell pixel intensity distributions were normalized by the median GFP intensity measured for each respective cell. For a given protein, the 95th percentile, hereafter referred to as the localization (LOC) value, was determined for each distribution among untreated cells. The median (x) and median absolute distribution (MAD) was calculated for the loc value and were used to determine threshold values for changes in protein localization. If a cell LOC value was greater than 2 MAD from the median (x + 2 MAD), it was considered as an increase in protein relocalization from the untreated condition. Conversely, if a cellular LOC value was less than 2 MAD from the median (x - 2 MAD), it was labeled as decreased localization from the untreated condition. The LOC value was calculated for all cells among all proteins and across all 7 timepoints in our study. Finally, the percentage of cells with a localization change was calculated by dividing the number of proteins with a localization change event (either increased or decreased) by the total number of cells segmented.
